## Building

To build the Ore CLI, you will need to have the Rust programming language installed. You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

You must have CUDA installed 

```sh
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU_INDEX>
```

Windows users

```sh
nvcc windows.cu -o windows
```

Linux users

```sh
nvcc linux.cu -o linux
```

Take the path to the executsble that was just created and replace the PATH_TO_EXE with the path to the .exe in the mine.rs.

Once you have Rust installed, you can build the Ore CLI by running the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```


```sh
./target/release/ore.exe --rpc "" --priority-fee 1 --keypair 'path to keypair' mine --threads 4
```

You will now run your hashing on the GPU instead of the CPU!
